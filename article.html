<p>Business class leveraged their power throughout the generation to keep power with them, and to face the competition comtinued demanding
for more and more skills, now suddenly the skills became so advaned and at the same time the business people were unable to understand it.
so the solution is business people to become more tech sevy. Dont cheat anyone but the data and information should pass through them.
Moreover they should aquire all the skills needed to succed as the knowledge and skills are readily available on internet. Knowledge is easy to
aquire as compared to skills. Tech people have missued it.</p>
<p>
Aquire <strong>Tech skills</strong>, now the winner is not someone with more money, or with skills,
but the winner is with all the basic skills to handle team and other aspect of tech, and let data and information flow through them.
Using money to buy skills and resource needed and learning it and implementing it on their own.</p>

<h2>summary:</h2>
Aquire skills even when you hire talent/ buy solution buy learning and not the product itself.
As only the people with basics will be able to contol and run the new businesses in future.

<ol>
  <li> You cant run away from aquiring skills in todays world</li>
  <li> knowledge is still the power, so let the knowledge pass through you</li>
</ol>
